The glossary can be used to collect terms that require further explanation or
linking to literature, but are too general or specific to deserve an own
section on these pages.

  Asymptotic freedom
    The fact that the coupling constant of the strong force increases in
    strength for lower momentum.

  Color confinement
    The fact that quarks only exist in colorless, bound states (quark groups of
    which the colors add up to 'white'). See also :term:`Asymptotic freedom`.

  Baryon
    A particle that consists of three quarks.

  Meson
    A particle that consists of two quarks.

  Hadron
    Particles that consist of two quarks (:term:`Meson`) or three quarks
    (:term:`Baryon`).

  Lattice QCD
      A numerical tool with which to study particle interactions mediated by
      the strong force at low momentum transfer

  Quark
    Elementary particle that constitutes hadronic matter.

  Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
    The theory that describes the strong force on the most fundamental level

  Quark Constituent Model
    Model with which to describe and categorize matter constituted of quarks
    (i.e. :term:`hadrons <Hadron>`)

  Strong force
    One of the four fundamental forces of the :term:`Standard Model`

  Standard Model
    Most fundamental description of matter and forces
