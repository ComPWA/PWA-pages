Glossary

.. warning::
  These pages and are **under development**.

The glossary can be used to collect terms that require further explanation or
linking to literature, but are too general or specific to deserve an own
section on these pages.


.. glossary::
  :sorted:

  K-matrix
    A real, symmetric and hermitian operator that is defined from the
    :term:`T-matrix` through $K^{-1} = T^{-1} + iI$. See
    :cite:`chungPartialWaveAnalysis1995,tanabashi48Resonances2019`.

  P-vector
    First described in :cite:`aitchisonMatrixFormalismOverlapping1972`. See
    also :cite:`chungPartialWaveAnalysis1995,tanabashi48Resonances2019`.

  Q-vector
    See :cite:`chungPartialWaveAnalysis1995,tanabashi48Resonances2019`.

  S-matrix
  scattering operator
    See :cite:`martinElementaryParticleTheory1970`, Ch.4.

  T-matrix
  transition operator
    The :term:`scattering operator` can split into a non-interacting component
    $I$ (identity operator) and a matrix $T$ that describes the actual
    interactions through $S = I + iT$. See
    :cite:`martinElementaryParticleTheory1970`, Ch.4, and
    :cite:`chungPartialWaveAnalysis1995`.

  asymptotic freedom
    The fact that the :term:`coupling constant` of the strong force increases
    in strength for lower momentum.

  baryon
    A particle that consists of three quarks.

  color confinement
    The fact that quarks only exist in colorless, bound states (quark groups of
    which the colors add up to 'white'). See also :term:`asymptotic freedom`.

  coupling constant
    <define>

  damping factor
  form factor
    Often defined with the symbol $B_{\alpha_i}$.

  formation experiment
    Experiments where particles $A$ and $B$ are collided, resulting in a
    reaction:

    .. math::

      A + B \to R \to C_1 + \dots + C_n,

    Here, $R$ is the resonance in which one is often interested in
    :term:`hadron spectroscopy`.

    See :cite:`tanabashi48Resonances2019`. Related: :term:`production
    experiment`.

  hadron
    Particles that consist of two quarks (:term:`meson`) or three quarks
    (:term:`baryon`).

  hadron spectroscopy
    .. todo:: Define hadron spectroscopy

  hyperon
    A :term:`baryon` with at least one strange :term:`quark`.

  lattice QCD
      A numerical tool with which to study particle interactions mediated by
      the strong force at low momentum transfer

  meson
    A particle that consists of two quarks.

  production experiment
  spectator particle
    Experiments of the kind:

    .. math::

      A + B \to R + S \to [C_1 + \dots + C_n] + S

      Z \to R + S \to [C_1 + \dots + C_n] + S

    Here, $R$ is the resonance in which one is often interested in
    :term:`hadron spectroscopy`, while $S$ is a spectator particle. The first
    case is comparable to a :term:`formation experiment`, while the second
    represents a decay process of particle $Z$.

    See :cite:`tanabashi48Resonances2019`.

  Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
    The theory that describes the strong force on the most fundamental level.
    See `PDG review on QCD
    <https://pdg.lbl.gov/2020/reviews/rpp2020-rev-qcd.pdf>`_.

  quark
    Elementary particle that constitutes hadronic matter.

  Quark Constituent Model (QCM)
    Model with which to describe and categorize matter constituted of quarks
    (i.e. :term:`hadrons <hadron>`). See :cite:`tanabashi15QuarkModel2019`.

  resonance
    See :cite:`tanabashi48Resonances2019`.

  Standard Model
    Most fundamental description of matter and forces

  strong force
    One of the four fundamental forces of the :term:`Standard Model`
