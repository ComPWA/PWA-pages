  These pages and are **under development**.

The glossary can be used to collect terms that require further explanation or
linking to literature, but are too general or specific to deserve an own
section on these pages.

  :sorted:

  asymptotic freedom
    The fact that the :term:`coupling constant` of the strong force increases
    in strength for lower momentum.

  baryon
    A particle that consists of three quarks.

  color confinement
    The fact that quarks only exist in colorless, bound states (quark groups of
    which the colors add up to 'white'). See also :term:`asymptotic freedom`.

  coupling constant
    <define>

  hadron
    Particles that consist of two quarks (:term:`meson`) or three quarks
    (:term:`baryon`).

  lattice QCD
      A numerical tool with which to study particle interactions mediated by
      the strong force at low momentum transfer

  meson
    A particle that consists of two quarks.

  Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
    The theory that describes the strong force on the most fundamental level.
    See `PDG review on QCD
    <https://pdg.lbl.gov/2020/reviews/rpp2020-rev-qcd.pdf>`_.

  quark
    Elementary particle that constitutes hadronic matter.

  Quark Constituent Model (QCM)
    Model with which to describe and categorize matter constituted of quarks
    (i.e. :term:`hadrons <hadron>`). See `PDG review on the Quark Model
    <https://pdg.lbl.gov/2020/reviews/rpp2020-rev-quark-model.pdf>`_.

  resonance
    See `PDG review on Resonances
    <https://pdg.lbl.gov/2020/reviews/rpp2020-rev-resonances.pdf>`_

  Standard Model
    Most fundamental description of matter and forces

  strong force
    One of the four fundamental forces of the :term:`Standard Model`
