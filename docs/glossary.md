# Glossary

```{warning}
These pages and are **under development**.

The glossary can be used to collect terms that require further explanation or
linking to literature, but are too general or specific to deserve an own
section on these pages.

:::{glossary}
:sorted:

K-matrix

  A real, symmetric and hermitian operator that is defined from the
  {term}`T-matrix` through $K^{-1} = T^{-1} + iI$. See
  {cite}`badalyanResonancesCoupledChannels1982,chungPartialWaveAnalysis1995`
  and {pdg-review}`Resonances`
  {cite:labelpar}`particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020`.

P-vector

  First described in {cite}`aitchisonMatrixFormalismOverlapping1972`. See also
  {cite}`chungPartialWaveAnalysis1995` and {pdg-review}`Resonances`
  {cite:labelpar}`particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020`.

Q-vector

  See {cite}`chungPartialWaveAnalysis1995` and
  {pdg-review}`Resonances`
  {cite:labelpar}`particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020`.

S-matrix
scattering operator

  See {cite}`martinElementaryParticleTheory1970`, Ch.4.

T-matrix
transition operator

  The {term}`scattering operator` can split into a non-interacting component
  $I$ (identity operator) and a matrix $T$ that describes the actual
  interactions through $S = I + iT$. See
  {cite}`martinElementaryParticleTheory1970`, Ch.4, and
  {cite}`chungPartialWaveAnalysis1995`.

asymptotic freedom

  The fact that the {term}`coupling constant` of the strong force increases
  in strength for lower momentum.

baryon
  A particle that consists of three quarks.

color confinement

  The fact that quarks only exist in colorless, bound states (quark groups of
  which the colors add up to 'white'). See also {term}`asymptotic freedom`.

coupling constant

  ```{todo} Define coupling constant
  ```

damping factor
form factor

  Often defined with the symbol $B_{\alpha_i}$.

formation experiment

  Experiments where particles $A$ and $B$ are collided, resulting in a
  reaction:

  $$
  A + B \to R \to C_1 + \dots + C_n,
  $$

  Here, $R$ is the resonance in which one is often interested in
  {term}`hadron spectroscopy`.

  See {pdg-review}`Resonances`
  {cite:labelpar}`particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020`. Related:
  {term}`production experiment`.

hadron

  Particles that consist of two quarks ({term}`meson`) or three quarks
  ({term}`baryon`).

hadron spectroscopy

  ```{todo} Define hadron spectroscopy
  ```

hyperon

  A {term}`baryon` with at least one strange {term}`quark`.

lattice QCD

  A numerical tool with which to study particle interactions mediated by the
  strong force at low momentum transfer

meson

  A particle that consists of two quarks.

production experiment
spectator particle

  Experiments of the kind:

  ```{math}
  A + B \to R + S \to [C_1 + \dots + C_n] + S

  Z \to R + S \to [C_1 + \dots + C_n] + S
  ```

  Here, $R$ is the resonance in which one is often interested in
  {term}`hadron spectroscopy`, while $S$ is a spectator particle. The first
  case is comparable to a {term}`formation experiment`, while the second
  represents a decay process of particle $Z$.

  See {pdg-review}`Resonances`
  {cite:labelpar}`particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020`.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)

  The theory that describes the strong force on the most fundamental level. See
  {pdg-review}`QCD`
  {cite:labelpar}`particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020`.

quark

  Elementary particle that constitutes hadronic matter.

Quark Constituent Model (QCM)

  Model with which to describe and categorize matter constituted of quarks
  (i.e. {term}`hadrons <hadron>`). See
  {cite:labelpar}`particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020`
  ({pdg-review}`Quark Model`).

resonance

  See {cite:labelpar}`particledatagroupReviewParticlePhysics2020`
  ({pdg-review}`Resonances`).

Standard Model

  Most fundamental description of matter and forces

strong force

  One of the four fundamental forces of the {term}`Standard Model`
