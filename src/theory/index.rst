What is Partial Wave Analysis? What are the waves? What makes them 'partial'?
And what is the purpose of analyzing such partial waves? While these questions
are the first that come to mind to anyone who first hears of the field of
Partial Wave Analysis (PWA), there are but few sources that give a satisfying
answer.

PWA is a specialized field that requires one to understand most complicated
aspects of the Standard Model as well as be up-to-date about the latest
research from hadron spectrometry. For this reason, PWA research papers often
merely glance of their place within particle physics and dive into the formulas
right away, leaving newcomers overwhelmed with theoretical subtleties that do
not answer those bigger questions.

These pages aim to provide context to some of the major literature, so that
they are easier to understand.
