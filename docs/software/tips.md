## Code Quality & Conventions

A highly recommended read for learning how to write good code: **Clean Code, by
Robert C. Martin**

Try and follow his advice, and keep in mind the 'boy scout rule':

> "Leave behind the code cleaner, then you found it"

For the python code we follow the
[pep8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Available automatic
source code highlighters and formatters are `flake8` and `autopep8`.

## Code editors

### Visual Studio Code

We have good experience with the open source code editor
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). VS Code is free and works
on Linux, Max, and Windows (particularly well integrated with
[WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)).

Some VS Code extensions that are definitely worth installing if you work on
{mod}`pycompwa` are:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
