These pages are **under development**.
:::

The PWA Software Pages serve two purposes:

1. They aim to bring together the [many Partial Wave Analysis frameworks](./software/index.qmd#software-inventory) out there on the market through interlinked documentation.
2. They provide a dynamic platform to collect and maintain knowledge on both PWA theory and software tools.
