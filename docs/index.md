The PWA Software Pages serve two purposes:

1. They aim to bring together the
   {ref}`many Partial Wave Analysis frameworks <software:Other recommendations>`
   out there on the market through interlinked documentation.

2. They provide a dynamic platform to collect and maintain knowledge on both
   PWA theory and software tools.
