What is Partial Wave Analysis? What are the waves? What makes them 'partial'?
And what is the purpose of analyzing such partial waves? While these questions
are the first that come to mind to anyone who first hears of the field of
Partial Wave Analysis (PWA), there are but few sources that give a satisfying
answer to these more contextual questions.

PWA is a specialized field that requires one to understand some of the most
complicated aspects of the Standard Model as well as be up-to-date about the
latest research from hadron spectrometry. For this reason, PWA research papers
often merely glance of their place within particle physics and dive into the
formulas right away, leaving newcomers overwhelmed by theoretical subtleties
that do not answer those bigger questions.

These pages aim to provide context to some of the major literature, so that
they are easier to understand. The pages are interlinked to both original
literature and {doc}`PWA software packages <software>`, so you can easily look
up more information or even try out some PWA software demos right away!
