Comparison with Measurements
----------------------------

Luminosity :math:`L`

Measurements :math:`N`

Cross section :math:`\sigma`

.. math::

  \frac{dN}{d\Phi_f} = L \cdot \frac{d\sigma}{d\Phi_f}

Number of events in a infinitesimal phase space element :math:`\Phi_f` is
proportional to the cross section of a initial state transitioning to the final
state in the infinitesimal phase space element.

This section should clear up the phase space element problem we are having. I'm
not sure its just a plotting problem. Since there one makes the transition from
unbinned to binned data...
