# [ADR-0000] Write overview of Partial Wave Analysis

Status: **proposed**

Deciders: @redeboer

## Context and Problem Statement

Existing literature on Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) theory is often dry and hard
to get into, while the theory cannot be ignored when doing PWA research. This is
a problem for a specialized and narrow field that is limited on manpower. In
addition, while much of PWA research itself relies heavily on specific analysis
frameworks, PWA publications hardly ever expand on the use or development of
those frameworks.

## Considered Options

1. Limit to a list of references.
2. Write specific theory in the codebase API.
3. Build a Sphinx webpage that summarizes and bundles existing literature.

## Decision Outcome

### Option 1 [rejected]: Limit to a list of references.

- **Positive**:
  - Don't have to spend time on rewriting
  - Good old academic style
- **Negative**:
  - Hard to link to specific pages
  - Less interactive (no 'navigating around' through sources)
  - Prone to become outdated

### Option 2 [rejected]: Write in codebase

- **Positive**:
  - Explanation right next to the code in one repository
  - [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
    works best within one webpage + API
  - Kept in sync per commit
- **Negative**:
  - No bundled overview for the user
  - Quickly becomes out-of-sync with the code

### Option 3 [accepted]: New PWA webpage

- **Positive**:
  - Neutral, not specific to one framework
  - Provides a bundled overview
  - Easy to keep up to date
  - Don't have to repeat oneself in each of the code repositories
  - Does not have to be academic (add disclaimer: do not use as your source, but
    carefully study the references we provide)
- **Negative**:
  - Have to link by URL to this external webpage from the APIs
  - API links become invalid once the structure of this theory webpage changes

## Specification

The theory pages consist of a few sub-pages (**bold**), each covering the
following topics. Each of them can be ticked off in follow-up PRs or ADRs.

Note that the pages should be condense and serve as an evolving guide to more
specific literature. In addition, the intended audience is experimental
physicists, so we should emphasize the advantages and limitations of the
different techniques.
