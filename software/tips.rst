Code Quality & Conventions
--------------------------
A highly recommended read for learning how to write good code:
**Clean Code, by Robert C. Martin**

Try and follow his advice, and keep in mind the 'boy scout rule'::

  "Leave behind the code cleaner, then you found it"

For the python code we follow the `pep8 standard
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. Available automatic source code
highlighters and formatters are ``flake8`` and ``autopep8``.


Code editors
------------

Visual Studio Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have good experience with the open source code editor `Visual Studio Code
<https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_. VS Code is free and works on Linux, Max,
and Windows (particularly well integrated with `WSL
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_).

Some VS Code extensions that are definitely worth installing if you work on
`pycompwa` are:

* `Python
  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_

* `C/C++
  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools>`_

* `GitLens
  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens>`_
