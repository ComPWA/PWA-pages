Working with Git
================

The source code `of ComPWA <https://github.com/ComPWA/ComPWA>`_ and `of
pycompwa <https://github.com/ComPWA/pycompwa>`_ is maintained through `Git
<https://git-scm.com/>`_, a distributed version control system that has become
the main standard in open source software development. Git allows you to track
source code files as you develop them over time, helps merging your
modifications with those of other developers, and gives you the flexibility to
switch between different ideas you're working on. Git works locally, is
blazingly fast in its operations, and will make it very difficult to lose or
corrupt files.

Despite all these benefits, however, Git can be difficult to comprehend and use
in a correct manner. As a starter, it definitely helps to `read up on the
fundamentals <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F>`_:
understanding how Git 'thinks' greatly helps using the Git terminal correctly.
But even then, Git requires practice, and it is only once you work together in
a team on a project that you get to use Git in its full scope.

These pages illustrates some of the main Git operations you use when working on
ComPWA projects. The instructions start from the basics, but are worth to read
even if you have used Git for a longer time already. New terms are linked to
the relevant section in the `Pro Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/>`_ book, one
of the most accessible resources on Git (and available in several languages!).

.. note::

  These tutorials assume that you have `installed Git
  <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_. The commands listed here are for a Unix
  system, although most Git commands are the same on all operating systems.
