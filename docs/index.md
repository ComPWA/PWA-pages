These pages and are **under development**.

The PWA Software Pages serve two purposes:

1. They aim to bring together the many Partial Wave Analysis frameworks out
   there on the market through interlinked documentation.

2. They provide a dynamic platform to collect and maintain knowledge on both
   PWA theory and software tools.

In addition, the {doc}`develop page <develop>` formulates some conventions and
tools that are used by
{ref}`affiliated software packages <software:Sub-projects>`.
