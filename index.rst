Welcome to the Partial Wave Analysis pages!
===========================================

.. note::

   These pages and are still **under development**.

The PWA Pages serve two purposes:

1. They are an attempt to bring together the many Partial Wave Analysis
   frameworks out there on the market.

2. Provide a dynamic platform to collect and maintain knowledge on both PWA
   theory and software tools.

As such, the pages consist two main components: **software** and **theory**.
The software serve as a guide through the available software tools that are
relevant to PWA software development. The theory pages are to be a collection
of the basics of PWA theory, along with references to more in-depth sources.
This is useful, because it is often difficult for newcomers to find their way
around in the growing amount of PWA literature and experimental results.

Currently, sub-projects of the PWA Pages are:

* `TensorWaves <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/tensorwaves>`_
* `PWA Expert System <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/expertsystem>`_
* `ComPWA <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/compwa>`_
* `pycompwa <https://compwa.github.io>`_
