  Color confinement
    The fact that quarks only exist in colorless, bound states (quark groups of
    which the colors add up to 'white'). See also :term:`Asymptotic freedom`.

  Baryon
    A particle that consists of three quarks.

  Meson
    A particle that consists of two quarks.

  Hadron
    Particles that consist of two quarks (:term:`Meson`) or three quarks
    (:term:`Baryon`).

  Quark
    Elementary particle that constitutes hadronic matter.

  Quark Constituent Model
    Model with which to describe and categorize matter constituted of quarks
    (i.e. :term:`hadrons <Hadron>`)

  Standard Model
