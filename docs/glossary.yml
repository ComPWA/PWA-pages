K-matrix: |
  A real, symmetric and hermitian operator that is defined from the {{< glossary T-matrix >}} through $K^{-1} = T^{-1} + iI$. See [@Badalian:1981xj; @Chung:1995dx] and [Resonances](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/reviews/rpp2024-rev-resonances.pdf) @ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz.

P-vector: |
  First described in @Aitchison:1972ay. See also @Chung:1995dx and [Resonances](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/reviews/rpp2024-rev-resonances.pdf) @ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz.

Q-vector: |
  See [@Chung:1995dx] and [Resonances](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/reviews/rpp2024-rev-resonances.pdf) @ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz.

S-matrix: |

scattering operator: |
  See [@Martin:1970hmp], Ch.4.

T-matrix: |

transition operator: |
  The {{< glossary scattering operator >}} can split into a non-interacting component $I$ (identity operator) and a matrix $T$ that describes the actual interactions through $S = I + iT$. See [@Martin:1970hmp], Ch.4, and [@Chung:1995dx].

asymptotic freedom: |
  The fact that the {{< glossary coupling constant >}} of the strong force increases in strength for lower momentum.

baryon: A particle that consists of three quarks.

color confinement: |
  The fact that quarks only exist in colorless, bound states (quark groups of which the colors add up to 'white'). See also {{< glossary asymptotic freedom >}}.

coupling constant: |

damping factor: |

form factor: |
  Often defined with the symbol $B_{\alpha_i}$.

formation experiment: |
  Experiments where particles $A$ and $B$ are collided, resulting in a reaction: |

  $$
  A + B \to R \to C_1 + \dots + C_n,
  $$

  Here, $R$ is the resonance in which one is often interested in {{< glossary "hadron spectroscopy" >}}.

  See [Resonances](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/reviews/rpp2024-rev-resonances.pdf) @ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz. Related: {{< glossary production experiment >}}.

hadron: |
  Particles that consist of two quarks ({{< glossary meson >}}) or three quarks ({{< glossary baryon >}}).

hadron spectroscopy: |

hyperon: |
  A {{< glossary baryon >}} with at least one strange {{< glossary quark >}}.

lattice QCD: |
  A numerical tool with which to study particle interactions mediated by the
  strong force at low momentum transfer

meson: |
  A particle that consists of two quarks.

production experiment: |

spectator particle: |
  Experiments of the kind: |

  $$
  \begin{align}{l}
  A + B \to R + S \to [C_1 + \dots + C_n] + S \\
  Z \to R + S \to [C_1 + \dots + C_n] + S
  \end{align}
  $$

  Here, $R$ is the resonance in which one is often interested in {{< glossary hadron spectroscopy >}}, while $S$ is a spectator particle. The first case is comparable to a {{< glossary formation experiment >}}, while the second represents a decay process of particle $Z$.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): |
  The theory that describes the strong force on the most fundamental level. See [QCD](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/reviews/rpp2024-rev-qcd.pdf) @ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz.

quark: |
  Elementary particle that constitutes hadronic matter.

Quark Constituent Model (QCM): |
  Model with which to describe and categorize matter constituted of quarks (i.e. {{< glossary "hadron" display="hadrons" >}}). See @ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz ([Quark Model](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/reviews/rpp2024-rev-quark-model.pdf)).

resonance: |
  See @ParticleDataGroup:2020ssz ([Resonances](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2024/reviews/rpp2024-rev-resonances.pdf)).

Standard Model: |
  Most fundamental description of matter and forces

strong force: |
  One of the four fundamental forces of the {{< glossary Standard Model >}}
