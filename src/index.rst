.. warning::
  These pages and are **under development**.

The PWA Software Pages serve two purposes:

1. They aim to bring together the many Partial Wave Analysis frameworks out
   there on the market through interlinked documentation.

2. They provide a dynamic platform to collect and maintain knowledge on both
   PWA theory and software tools.

As such, the pages consist three main components: :doc:`theory <theory>`,
:doc:`analysis techniques <analysis>`, and :doc:`software <software>`. The
theory pages are to be a collection of the basics of PWA theory, along with
references to more in-depth sources. This is useful, because it is often
difficult for newcomers to find their way around in the growing amount of PWA
literature and experimental results. The analysis section visits some of the
common statistics techniques that you need to be familiar with to do PWA. The
software pages serve as a guide through the available software tools that are
relevant to PWA software development.

Currently, sub-projects of the PWA Pages are:

* `TensorWaves <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/tensorwaves>`_
* `PWA Expert System <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/expertsystem>`_
* `ComPWA <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/compwa>`_
* `pycompwa <https://compwa.github.io>`_

platforms? Welcome to contact the `Common Partial Wave Analysis
<https://github.com/ComPWA>`_ organization!
