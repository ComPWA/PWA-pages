Welcome to the Partial Wave Analysis pages!
===========================================

.. note::

   These pages and are **under development**.

The PWA Software Pages serve two purposes:

1. They aim to bring together the many Partial Wave Analysis frameworks out there on the market through interlinked documentation.

2. They provide a dynamic platform to collect and maintain knowledge on both PWA theory and software tools.

As such, the pages consist two main components: :doc:`theory <theory/index>` and :doc:`software <software/index>`. The theory pages are to be a collection of the basics of PWA theory, along with references to more in-depth sources. This is useful, because it is often difficult for newcomers to find their way around in the growing amount of PWA literature and experimental results. The software pages serve as a guide through the available software tools that are relevant to PWA software development.

Currently, sub-projects of the PWA Pages are:

* `TensorWaves <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/tensorwaves>`_
* `PWA Expert System <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/expertsystem>`_
* `ComPWA <https://pwa.readthedocs.io/projects/compwa>`_
* `pycompwa <https://compwa.github.io>`_

Want to contribute or be part of this collection of PWA documentation platforms? Welcome to contact the `Common Partial Wave Analysis <https://github.com/ComPWA>`_ organization!
